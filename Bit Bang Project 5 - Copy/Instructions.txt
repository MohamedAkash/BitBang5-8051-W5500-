1. To change the board to 6T mode cycle instead of 12. We set cpu_6t_enabled=true as an option in the makefile for the stcgal. Look at the difference between 
   bit bang 4 makefile and bit bang 5 makefile
2. when using sdcc use --model-small, I was told to use model-medium for now and when I figured it all out. I can switch to small and change the application up
   to use sdcc to --model-medium, look at the makefile and see the differences. The only change is changing the CFlags.


Part 2 -
1. the stc89 operates on full-duplex (both sides can transmit simultaneously) which can transmit and receive simultaneously and at
   different baud rates
2. Look from 109-123, then 154
3. https://embetronicx.com/tutorials/microcontrollers/8051/8051-uart-tutorial-serial-communication/
4. Able to read and write to the Serial using 8051 (6T machine cycle)
5. Setup Basic SPI communication for WIZnet in C (I am currently here)
	- Read/Write to WIZnet
	- set SOCKETS for WIZnet (UDP/TCP)
	- Set WIZnet registers for IP Add, MAC, Port, Subnet and Gateway
6. Verify the Ethernet Connectivity via Ping or similar
